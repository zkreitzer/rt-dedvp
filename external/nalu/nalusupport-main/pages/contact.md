## Software Bug Reports

To help us get bugs fixed as quickly as possible please include as much information as possible in your email, including:

1. Steps to reproduce.
2. Expected versus actual behavior.
3. The latest NaluScope log file and the appropriate crash report, where applicable.

The log and crash reports files can be found by clicking the "Open Log Folder" button in the Help menu.
There is no need to include a crash report if the application has not crashed.

The crash report with the most recent date may not be the one you are looking for.
If you have recently reopened the application, the latest crash report is the second-most-recent one.
